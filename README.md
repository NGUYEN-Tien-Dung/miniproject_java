# Masters project in JAVA : Application for a bibliography

This application is a graduate year basic project in JAVA.
It aims to create and deploy on Android platform a software which manage a list of books and articles.

The input is a bibtex file, gathering all the books/articles, with several attributes (e.g. year of publication, title, number of pages...).

The bibtex file may be imported, and a pdf file can be stored in the application folder for each paper.

The top bar is a research bar. An article can be found by typing a tag in. A tag is manually set by the user, and is stored in an XML file so that all tags are recovered for the next launch of the software.

Depending on the articles read, a list of suggestions is proposed at the bottom of the window.

By right click, it is possible to delete a paper from the current bibliography.
